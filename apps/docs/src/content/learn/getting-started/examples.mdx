Threlte is a renderer and component library for using Three.js in a **declarative** and **state-driven** way in Svelte apps.

Threlte is comprised of six distinct packages to allow you to import only what you need:

This is the heart of Threlte, providing simple transparent Svelte binding to Three.js

### [@threlte/extras](/docs/reference/extras/getting-started)

A collection of components, plugins and hooks that extend Threlte with additional functionality.

### [@threlte/rapier](/docs/reference/rapier/getting-started)

Provides components to enable performant physics in your Threlte application through the [Rapier engine](https://rapier.rs/)

### [@threlte/theatre](/docs/reference/theatre/getting-started)
