  We'd love your help to make, add to and edit the examples. There lots of examples from
  [three.js](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_animation_keyframes) and
  [r3f](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/examples) that could serve as
  inspiration. Read through the [contributing
  guide](https://github.com/threlte/threlte/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Examples
  README](https://github.com/threlte/threlte/blob/main/apps/docs/src/examples/README.md) to get
  started.
