[GLSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language) is a low-level graphics programming language that underlies the [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) standard that serves as the foundation for web graphics technologies like Three.js and Threlte. If you want to write special effects or scenes with large numbers of elements in a performant way, it's worth checking out.

## GLSL Resources

GLSL (Graphics Library Shader Language) is a critical part of shader programming, which is central to achieving high-quality visual effects in Threlte.

### [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/)
This resource breaks down complex shader programming into bite-sized lessons. A great starting point for anyone new to shaders.

### [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/)
An in-depth resource for learning OpenGL and GLSL, covering topics from beginner to advanced levels. Learn OpenGL offers tutorials that are easily applicable to Threlte's context.

We hope you find these resources valuable in your journey to mastering Threlte. Happy Learning!
